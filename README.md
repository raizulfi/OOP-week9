# # Class Design and Implementation Case
1.(a) By making use of an example from the above scenario, distinguish between a class and an instantiation of a class. (3 points)
	

> a class acts as a template, defining the shared characteristics and behaviors.
>  an instantiation represents a specific object created based on that class, with its own distinct attribute values. 
>  
>  The class provides a standardized structure, and the instantiation represents a tangible instance of that structure with its unique properties.
>  
>  in the context of the examples above, we can consider a mangager class being defined. class will form attributes like their name, employee ID, job title, and base salary. an instantiation of the manger class named  Raihan Zulfi. Raihan Zulfi is a manager within the company. As an instantiation of the manager class, I would have my own unique values for the attributes defined in the class.
